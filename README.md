# CryptoTool

CryptoTool is an educational cryptography tool built in Golang. The project aims to implement both classic and modern encryption algorithms, such as AES, RSA, and others, to facilitate learning and understanding how these techniques work. Additionally, it is designed to be used as a library in future Go projects, providing functionalities for encrypting and decrypting data.

## Objectives

- Practice and study cryptography by implementing a variety of algorithms.
- Use the implemented functions as a library (`cryptoLib`) in other Go projects.
- Support both classical and modern cryptographic techniques.

## Features

- AES encryption and decryption
- RSA encryption and decryption (future implementation)
<!-- - Atbash cipher (future implementation) -->
- Additional algorithms coming soon

## Usage

To use CryptoTool as a library in your Go projects, import the necessary packages and call the encryption or decryption functions.
